This is handy fabric config skeleton for django projects.
Target systems are Centos 5 and 6 (remote); Ubuntu 12 and OpenSUSE 11 (local) for now.

Assuming all systems have python 2.7 installed and it has pip and virtualenv packages.
I used some django 1.4 - specific paths (e.g for settings.py and wsgi.py). You may need to correct it accordingly
